INTRODUCTION
In today's digital era, wireless networks (WiFi) have become an essential part of our daily lives. From accessing the Internet, connecting smart devices, to supporting high-tech applications, WiFi plays an important role in improving quality of life and work efficiency.
This project focuses on researching and applying WiFi technology in remote device control, specifically controlling rain covers through the ESP01-S module and Atmega328P chip. The goal of the project is to build a SmartHome system via WiFi, allowing users to open/close the cover remotely through smartphones or laptops.
Through implementing this project, I hope to not only better understand the operating principles of WiFi and wireless communication protocols, but also apply this knowledge in practice, contributing to the development of smart technology solutions in the future.

THINGSPEAK ALERT (I USE THINGSPEAK SO IN CASES IF YOU CONNECT TO ANOTHER WIFI, YOU STILL CAN SEE WHAT HAPPEN AT YOUR HOME :>)

HOW TO USE:
First, access Thinkspeak. Then navigate to MATLAB Analytics, then copy the code
